# Arduino-Radar-System
The Arduino Radar System uses ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino microcontroller to detect objects by measuring the time for sound waves to return. It provides real-time distance readings on a display, ideal for learning distance measurement and radar systems. Applications include security, robotics, and obstacle avoidance.
